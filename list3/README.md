# Design Patterns in Java

This repository contains descriptions of various design patterns implemented in Java.

---

# Abstract Factory
### Creates families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

---

# Adapter
### Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.

---

# Builder
### Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.

---

# Composite
### Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

---

# Decorator
### Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically.

---

# Facade
### Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

---

# Factory Method
### Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects.

---

# Singleton
### Ensures only one instance of a class exists.

---

# State
### Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

---

# Mediator
### Defines an object that controls how other objects interact.

---

# Observer
### Notifies multiple objects about state changes.

---

# Prototype
### Creates duplicate objects while keeping performance in mind.
